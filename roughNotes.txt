idempotent : These are functions that produce the same output for a given input no matter

Common docker commands:
docker-compose -f docker-compose-LocalExecutor.yml up -d  :
docker-compose A Docker tool to define and manage multi-container applications using a YAML configuration file.
-f option tell docker-compose that we're passing a file(docker-compose-LocalExecutor.yml)
up : this will build, create, start and attach container. Incase it's not build, it build it first
-d : this ensures the continer runs in the background, so you get your terminal control back after spinning it up.


pgcli connection: 
pgcli -h localhost -p 5432 -U airflow -d airflow
